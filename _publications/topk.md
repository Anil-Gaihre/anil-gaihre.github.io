title: "Dr. Top-k: Delegate-Centric Top-k on GPUs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-11-14-DrTopk
excerpt: ' Dr. Top-k, is a Delegate-centric top-k system on GPUs that can reduce the workloads of top-k methods significantly. In particular, the works contains three major contributions: First, we introduce a comprehensive design of the delegate-centric concept, including maximum delegate, delegate-based filtering, and β delegate mechanisms to help reduce the workload for top-k up to more than 99%. Second, due to the difficulty and importance of deriving a proper subrange size, we perform a rigorous theoretical analysis, coupled with thorough experimental validations to identify the desirable subrange size. Third, we introduce four key system optimizations to enable fast multi-GPU top-k computation. Taken together, this work constantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.'
