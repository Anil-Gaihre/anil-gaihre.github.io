excerpt: 'XBFS introduces dynamic optimizations to BFS on GPUs. It adaptively uses four either novel or optimized scan approaches to rapidly generate frontier queue. Further, inspired by the observation that bottom-up BFS experiences unpredictable amounts of workload, the paper proposes the novel dynamic workload balancing method. Third, the work designs and implements the first truly asynchronous BFS traversal.'
