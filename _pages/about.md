My name is Anil Gaihre, and I work as an High-Performance Computing (HPC) Engineer at NVIDIA. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology. My expertise includes parallel algorithms and accelerated computing on multi-core architectures, with research spanning graph analytics, scalable linear solvers, and genomics.

## Professional Experience

Currently, I leverage my skills in parallel computing and GPU optimization at NVIDIA to tackle complex challenges in associated with accelerating genomics tool Parabricks. My journey in high-performance computing began right after my undergraduate studies when I worked at E&T Nepal Pvt. Ltd., developing CFD simulation tools using NVIDIA GPUs. This industrial experience laid the foundation for my academic pursuits, leading to research positions at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Stevens Institute of Technology. The pinnacle of my academic journey was my Ph.D. at Stevens, focusing on "Accelerating Data-Analytical Algorithms on GPUs." During this time, I also collaborated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where I developed GPU-friendly parallel algorithms for sparse linear solvers. This combination of industry and academic experiences has shaped my expertise in GPU-accelerated computing, spanning from CFD simulations to advanced data analytics and sparse linear algebra.

## Research Focus

My doctoral research, titled "Accelerating Data-Analytical Algorithms on GPUs," has contributed significantly to the field of high-performance computing. Key areas of my work include:

- GPU-accelerated algorithms for graph traversal for sparse matrix operations
- Scalable solutions for top-k computations and symbolic factorization
- Applications in cryptocurrency analysis and blockchain technology

## Publications and Achievements

My research has resulted in several high-impact publications in prestigious conferences and journals in the field of high-performance computing and big data analytics. Notable works include:

- XBFS: Exploring runtime optimizations for breadth-first search on GPUs
